                                 NO HT - CPU LIMIT $CPU_LIMIT_PERCENT %
=====================================================================================================
This script will install your node as a service. It will run your node from the binary file.
It will also disable HT (Hyper Threading), and it will set a CPUQuota limit of $CPU_LIMIT_PERCENT %
